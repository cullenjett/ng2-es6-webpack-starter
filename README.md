# Angular2, ES6, and Webpack Starter

Because TypeScript can suck it.

This is still very much a work in progress, so enter at your own risk. Definitely don't use this garbage for production.

## What is this?

This project is meant to be a simple starter template for Angular2+ apps that only uses ES6 (no TypeScript) by following the [TypeScript to JavaScript](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/ts-to-js.html) guidelines from Angular. The aim is to ease the transition to Angular 2 and avoid the extra noise from TypeScript, System.js, etc.


## Run It
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
3. Open `localhost:8080`
4. Code
